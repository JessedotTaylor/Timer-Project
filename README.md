Custom view HTML page for Ontime timers. Replicates the way LIFE currently uses ProPresenter7 cue screen display.

To use, download the HTML file and move it into the Pro Presenter folder in the documents folder. Open the file and copy the address. Edit the Stage Display in PP7 and create a 1920x1080 box. Choose fill as "Web" and paste the address.
Support added for a variable Ontime Server address. Append file address with ?ws=ip_address:4001 
Example if IP address is 127.0.0.1 (local host): file:///Users/cg/Documents/ProPresenter/index.html?ws=127.0.0.1:4001
